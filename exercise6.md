  Label the bottles from #1 to #20. Take i pills from each i-th bottle and we get 1 + 2 + ... + 20 = 231 pills in total. Measure the total weight w (grams) of those pills on the scale. Then ((w - 231) / 0.1)-th bottle is the one that has heavier pills.

  We want to choose the easier one. It is the one with the higher probability. The probability that we win each of the games is p and p^3 + 3(1-p)p^2, respectively. Therefore, we should choose Game 1 if and only if p >= p^3 + 3(1-p)p^2, solving which we get 0 <= p <= 1/2.
