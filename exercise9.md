  I'd store the data in the form of some Python object like a dictionary, design APIs, create a GitHub repository and host it using [PyPI](https://pypi.org/). If there's any other server that I'm supposed to use (e.g. one that belongs to my company), I'd just use it. If not, since this is a small service that only up to 1,000 clients use, I'd first try to host it on my own [GitHub Pages](https://kumatheworld.github.io/). If it doesn't work out, I'd consider using a cloud hosting service or designing a server on my own using [Raspberry Pi](https://www.raspberrypi.org/).
